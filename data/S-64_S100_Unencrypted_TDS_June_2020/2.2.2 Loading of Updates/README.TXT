described below:

			32 31.5S, 60 57.3E

		marked by East and West Cardinal buoys at:

		    and	32 31.5S, 60 57.16E respectively.

101AA00AA5X01SW.002	Insert a prohibited entry area between
		Panther and Tinker Shoals timed to 
		come into force at 20050220. A cautionary
		area in the same location is in force 
		from date of issue to 20050220.

		EDTN 1, UPDN 2, ISDT 20200730

101AA00AA5X01SW.003	Extend western limits of the prohibited 
		entry area (delete cautionary area).

		EDTN 1, UPDN 3, ISDT 20200730

101AA00AA5X01SW.005	Insert 15 metre sounding at
		32 31.7S, 60 57.4E

		Because of how UKHO's ENC production
		software works, the update message actually
		deletes all soundings before re-inserting
		them with the additional 15m sounding.
