abstract = {Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) presents a great challenge of System of Systems integration across organisational and political boundaries. One existing paradigm that can address the scale of the challenge is that of the Sensor Web. In this paradigm, the internet is evolving into an active, macro sensing instrument, capable of drawing sensory data from around the globe to the fingertips of individuals. The Sensor Web will support scientific research and facilitate transparent political decision making. This article presents some of the technologies explored and activities engaged in by the GEOSS Sensor Web community, towards achieving GEOSS goals. Keywords:},
